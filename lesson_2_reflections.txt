What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a file with .git is generated

we need it becoz

Git is a version control system. It's useful for a number of reasons:

    It stores old versions of files, so you can always look up old versions. This also removes the need to leave useless code commented out and getting in the way.
    It makes it easy to share code with other people (they can "clone" your repository and work on it, and then share the changes back with you).
    You can get free hosting for your project, so you can access the code anywhere.
    Since you have old versions available, you can mess around with the code as much as you want, safe in the knowledge that you can "revert" back to a previous version instantly if you change your mind.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

git actually allows us more flexibilities to make commits our own way by using a staging area where we can manually decide that which changes should be committed instead of writing whole bunch of commits for every file.

**What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

if we want to make an experiments with our projects without actually making changes in our original code branches help a lot.
for this make an extra branch and shift to that branch without affecting the master branch.

**How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

with the help of the diagram we can actually visulize the whole commits in the branch and can see which commit was made in which branch.
